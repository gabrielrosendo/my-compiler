OPTIMIZERS ARE BROKEN
COMMENTED IT OUT FOR NOW TO WORK ON CODE GENERATOR

IF VOID FUNCTION TYPE AND THERES A RETURN STATEMENT, THROW ERROR

TAC DOES NOT HANDLE ARRAYS

FLOAT IMPLEMENTATION

FREE MEMORY PROPERLY

ARRAY ACCESS NOT WORKING PROPERLY (CHECK INPUT-ARRAY.TXT)
    arr[1] = 5;
    int b = arr[1];
DOES NOT ASSIGN B TO 5 AS OF NOW

Type Handling
   - [ ] Add typecasting by default.
   - Add floats and other types
     - Example:
       Expr: ID BinOp ID {...}
            | LPAREN TYPE RPAREN ID BinOp LPAREN TYPE RPAREN ID {...}
   - [ ] Decide between type coercion or explicit casting.

Optimization of Functions and Calls
   - [ ] Apply previously discussed optimizations inside function definitions:
     - Peephole optimization
     - Dead code elimination
        - Detect functions defined but never called

Arithmetic and Operator Precedence
   - [X] Add support for `/` and `*`.
   - [ ] Ensure operator precedence rules are followed.
